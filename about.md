Hello there. I've been programming since I was about 11. Since then, I've learned a lot about it and that allowed me give back to community.

I love trying and experimenting new technology, open-source and I talk about technologies and practices I want to share with the world.

I tweet from `@kriansa`, you can mail me in daniel at garajau.com.br and you can find my projects on [Github](https://github.com/kriansa){:target="blank"}.

My OpenPGP key is available for download [here]({{ "/pgp.asc" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) or you can get it using `gpg --recv-keys 0x3E7884756312F945`. Fingerprint: **BC27 7BE0 9E8A 6F10 59C3  911B 3E78 8475 6312 F945**.
