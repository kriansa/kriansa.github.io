Hello there. I've been programming since I was about 11. Since then, I've learned a lot about it and that allowed me give back to community.

I love trying and experimenting new technology, open-source and I talk about technologies and practices I want to share with the world.

I tweet from `@kriansa`, you can mail me in daniel at garajau.com.br and you can find my projects on [Github](https://github.com/kriansa){:target="blank"}.
